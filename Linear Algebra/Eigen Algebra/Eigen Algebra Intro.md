### Understanding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- The term 'eigen' translates to 'characteristic', referring to the characteristic properties of transformations.
- Eigenvectors are special vectors that remain on their original span after a transformation, while eigenvalues indicate how much their length changes.

### Geometric Interpretation of Transformations

- Linear transformations can include scalings, rotations, and shears, which can be visualized using shapes like squares.
- Specific vectors, such as horizontal and vertical ones, can remain unchanged or change in length, highlighting their special status as eigenvectors.

### Examples of Transformations

- In pure shear, only one vector remains unchanged, while in rotation, no eigenvectors exist as all vectors change direction.
- The concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors apply similarly in higher dimensions, with the focus on identifying characteristic vectors and their corresponding values.
