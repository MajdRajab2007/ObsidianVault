1. **Introduction to Reflection**:
    
    - The goal is to reflect a vector in a plane defined by two vectors (v1 and v2) while a third vector (v3) is out of the plane.
2. **Identifying Vectors**:
    
    - Vectors v1 = (1, 1, 1) and v2 = (2, 0, 1) are in the plane.
    - Vector v3 = (3, 1, -1) is out of the plane.
3. **Applying the Gram-Schmidt Process**:
    
    - Normalize v1 to get the first orthonormal vector e1.
    - Calculate u2 by subtracting the projection of v2 onto e1 from v2, then normalize to get e2.
    - For u3, subtract the projections of v3 onto e1 and e2, then normalize to get e3.
4. **Constructing the Transformation Matrix**:
    
    - The transformation matrix (E) is formed using the orthonormal vectors e1, e2, and e3.
5. **Reflecting a Vector**:
    
    - To reflect a vector r (e.g., r = (2, 3, 5)), express it in the plane's basis using E inverse.
    - Apply the reflection transformation, which keeps the e1 and e2 components the same and inverts the e3 component.
6. **Final Transformation**:
    
    - Convert the reflected vector back to the original basis using the transformation matrix E.
    - The final result for the reflected vector r' is calculated.
7. **Conclusion**:
    
    - The process illustrates how linear algebra simplifies complex geometric transformations, such as reflections, which can be applied in practical scenarios like facial recognition.
